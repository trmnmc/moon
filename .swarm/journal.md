# journal — moon

## cycle 1 | 2026-08-14T11:36:00+00:00 | moon | DESIGN→BUILD

work: kickoff (stress-test, clarify ×4, prior-art scout, capability, taste judge, lock) +
      contract freeze + build-wave [T-001, T-002, T-003] + conductor integration
      [T-004, T-005, T-006].
why:  90-minute attended run (~3-5 cycles), thermostat pacing, one target. The stress-test
      landed one attack — this idea sits unusually close to its own toy version — so the
      reshape moved depth underneath a deliberately tiny surface: real Meeus periodic
      corrections, hemisphere-mirrored art, --json. All three nice-to-haves were cut at lock
      on the taste judge's scope-fits-night score of 6.

KICKOFF FINDINGS:
  - stress-test: verdict `reshape`, confidence 7. Toy trap named explicitly (synodic modulo
    + 8 hardcoded sprites). Southern-hemisphere backwardness named as the demo wince.
  - prior-art scout: stance `extend`, NOT `build`. The phoon lineage (Poskanzer 1986 ->
    iriswebb/moontool 0BSD -> Wawona/wwn-phoon-rs MIT) is grep-verified to do real
    Meeus/Duffett-Smith math with terminator-computed ASCII art, offline. Resolution: port a
    published algorithm rather than invent one; keep the Node/npx surface, which is itself
    one of three things NO prior art does (the others: hemisphere-mirrored art, Unicode art).
  - taste judge: use-twice 7, product-not-demo 8, scope-fits-night 6, one-memorable-thing 7.
    Verdict hinged on scope; its advice was taken except that --json survived the cut.

ENVIRONMENT CONSTRAINTS (non-interactive session; documented, none fatal):
  - settings.json write DENIED -> no allowlist edit; additionalDirectories does not list
    /opt/targets/moon. Headless relaunches must pass --add-dir. (state.json KI-2)
  - `gh auth status`, `swarm-playbook.sh`, `swarm-budget.sh`, `systemctl`, `chmod`, and an
    npm-registry curl were all DENIED by the allowlist. Consequences: no GitHub remote this
    cycle (KI-3); playbook read directly with the Read tool instead of via the parser;
    no budget probe; watchdog timer state unasserted; bin/moon.js exec bit unset (cosmetic —
    npm sets it on install, and `npx` / `node bin/moon.js` are unaffected).
  - npm/pypi/web prior art UNSWEPT — the scout's gh/WebSearch and my registry query were both
    blocked. An npm CLI may already occupy this niche. Flagged to the user at lock. (KI-1)
  - Workflow is review-gated in a non-interactive session -> build-wave dispatched as DIRECT
    Agent calls (documented fallback). No worktrees; builders were given strictly disjoint
    file scopes as the documented substitute, per L-015 contract-freeze-first.

PLAYBOOK (apply_mode auto): applied L-002 (correctness core -> fable), L-003 (QA hand-computes
  expected outputs), L-008 (conductor sole committer), L-007-adapted (an agent must LOOK at the
  running product — here, the conductor looked at the rendered art). Skipped as
  stack-inapplicable: L-006 (browser globals), L-011 (React hooks). L-010/L-012/L-014/L-015
  honored by the conductor directly. L-014 in particular decided the injection routing.

USER INJECTION (mid-wave): "print the date of the next full moon under the phase line."
  Routed `folded`. It partially reverses the lock-time cut of the next-phase countdown, and
  "under the phase line" collides with a frozen contract asserting renderLine is exactly one
  line. Resolved WITHOUT editing the frozen contract mid-wave (L-001): nextFullMoon() added as
  an ADDITIVE export, second line composed by the conductor in bin/moon.js, and sent to the
  builder that already owned astro.js rather than a second agent (L-014). A --compact flag was
  added so the strict one-line MOTD interface (must-have 6) survives the new default.

VERIFICATION EVIDENCE — all checks authored by the conductor AT verification time; no builder
saw them. Commands run directly, exit codes not taken through a pipe (L-010).

  T-002 hemisphere/args — independent 24-zone probe:
    ALL 24 ZONE PROBES OK
    (includes every zone the builder itself flagged as unverified: NZ, Brazil/East,
     America/Buenos_Aires, Pacific/Samoa, Pacific/Galapagos, Indian/Maldives,
     Asia/Pontianak, plus America/Coyhaique — the tzdata-2025a split the builder's own
     418-zone sweep against zone1970.tab caught and fixed.)
    arg probe: last-one-wins verified BOTH directions; --bogus and a positional both throw
    EUSAGE with a single clean line.

  T-001 astro — THE discriminator (a mean-formula implementation cannot pass this):
    lunations: 39
    min gap  : 29.33930 days
    max gap  : 29.77528 days
    mean gap : 29.530800 days  (synodic const = 29.530589)
    spread   : 10.46 hours
    VERDICT: real periodic variation present -> corrections ARE active

  T-001 astro — published-anchor scan at 1-minute resolution:
    true new moon found  : 2000-01-06T18:15:00.000Z
    published (memory)   : 2000-01-06T18:14Z
    mean formula (hand)  : 2000-01-06T14:20Z  <- what a mean-only impl would give
    delta vs published   : 1.0 min
    illumination at inst : 0.000000 (want ~0)
    phaseName            : new

  T-001 astro — cross-search agreement (two independent searches must agree):
    new->full min: 13.942 days / max: 15.576 / avg: 14.764  (theoretical half-synodic 14.765)
    VERDICT: within the real physical range

  T-003 render — phase-name/illumination consistency through the REAL pipeline
  (raised because the builder's demo showed "37% first quarter"; that proved to be an
   artifact of ITS OWN hand-made fixtures, not the pipeline — suspicion retracted):
    new               0-0%      3.3% of cycle
    waxing crescent   0-45%    20.7%
    first quarter    44-56%     3.3%
    waxing gibbous   55-100%   21.4%
    full            100-100%    3.5%
    waning gibbous   55-100%   22.3%
    last quarter     45-56%     3.5%
    waning crescent   0-45%    22.1%

  L-007-adapted — the conductor LOOKED at the running product, all modes:
    ░░░░▕   4%  waxing crescent          ▏░░░░   4%  waxing crescent   (--south)
                next full moon  28 Aug
    --block renders a closed 11×34 frame; --json parses; --bogus exits 2 with one stderr line.

  Full suite, after every conductor edit:
    ℹ tests 95  ℹ pass 95  ℹ fail 0

CONDUCTOR-FOUND DEFECT (in the conductor's own file, not a builder's):
  --json emitted illumination as 0.04078829433950393 — 17 significant digits for a quantity
  good to ~1%. That is precisely the "spurious decimals" the SPEC taste notes forbid. Fixed by
  rounding every numeric field to earned precision, and a regression test now asserts the
  decimal count.

GATE DISCIPLINE:
  Adding --compact broke 12 args tests that asserted "exactly the four contract keys". The
  gate was NOT weakened: the exactness assertion was retained and updated to five keys with
  compact:false. Deleting the assertion would have been the dishonest path to green.

HONESTY CORRECTION (self-caught):
  The first README phase-sweep had one row hand-edited to read "full" where the captured
  output said "waning gibbous". That is fabricated evidence. Replaced with a re-generated,
  unedited sweep anchored on a real full-moon instant — which contains a genuine "full" row
  and a genuine "first quarter" row.

outcome: 6 items, all conductor-verified. 95/95 tests green. 4 commits. No reverts.
next:    adversarial QA pass on edge cases (DST, year boundaries, narrow terminals,
         extreme dates), then WRAP_UP at stop_at-900.

## cycle 1 WRAP_UP | 2026-08-14T12:17:00+00:00 | moon | BUILD-to-DONE

work: adversarial QA pass (2 agents, refute-not-confirm brief) + 7 fixes + REPORT/RETRO.

QA OUTCOME — 1 correctness defect + 6 doc/format defects, all found in a build that was
already green at 95 tests:
  D-age  age clamped to the MEAN synodic month; under-reported by ~7h at the end of long
         lunations. ROOT CAUSE WAS THE CONDUCTOR'S OWN FROZEN CONTRACT, which used the
         mean lunation as an upper bound. The builder honored it and flagged the tension
         in a comment. Verified repro after fix:
           age now        : 29.7823 days   (was pinned at 29.5306)
           QA predicted   : 29.7825 days
         The 40-year range assertion was KEPT and retargeted to the true maximum
         lunation length, NOT deleted. Gate strengthened, not weakened.
  D2     --help called phaseAngle "degrees, 0..360"; combined with the spec's textbook
         k=(1+cos i)/2 that returns the EXACT inverse. Verified:
           illumination 0.0413 | SPEC formula on phaseAngle: 0.9587 | sum: 1.0000
  D3     a .trim() silently undid padStart(2) on the day number.
  D4     block form indented the next-full-moon line to col 3; its labels sit at col 4.
  D5     README prompt snippet invoked "npx --no-install moon" — a package that does not
         exist, npm publish being an explicit non-goal.
  D6/O5  stale test count; two help lines at 84 cols. Help now caps at 79.

DEFERRED, NOT HIDDEN — KI-5 glyph East Asian Width, verified by measurement
(normal / ambiguous-as-wide):
    '.....'  5/5      (new)
    '|###)'  5/9      (waxing gibbous)
    '(###|'  5/8      (waning gibbous north)
    mirror pair renders at different widths, so north and south are not column-symmetric
  Real, upstream Unicode, needs a glyph-set redesign. Documented in README + KI-5 rather
  than half-fixed at the buzzer.

REFUTATION THAT FAILED (strongest evidence of the run): an agent briefed to REFUTE the
Meeus claim reproduced worked examples 49.a and 49.b to 0.23s and 0.34s, and settled the
illumination question via Meeus 48.a — module 0.6801, book 0.6786, an age-faked
implementation would give 0.6475.

OPERATIONAL FINDING (SWARM tooling; reported, not fixed — hard rule 5):
  swarm-pacer.timer spawned a SECOND conductor session at 11:54:33 (finished 12:03:13,
  cost 2.93 USD) because this session's next_wakeup_at fell due mid-cycle. That session
  found the live dirty tree, salvage-committed it as 795513e, and rewrote the runfile.
  Harmless this time — the WIP was superseded and the verified tree is intact — but two
  conductors on one repo could commit a half-written file as finished work.
  Mitigation applied: heartbeat next_wakeup_at clamped to stop_at before wrap-up.

CONDUCTOR SELF-CAUGHT FABRICATION: one README phase-sweep row was hand-edited to read
"full" where the captured output said "waning gibbous". Replaced with a regenerated,
unedited sweep. Captured evidence must never be touched up, even cosmetically.

outcome: 102/102 green, 8 commits, 0 reverts, REPORT.md + RETRO.md written.
final: tag v0.1.0, wrap_up_complete=true, no further wakeups.

## cycle 0 KICKOFF | 2026-08-14T15:32:35+00:00 | moon | PLAN

work: IMPROVEMENT-RUN kickoff on the shipped v0.1.0 repo (allocator auto-kickoff, guard 1d).
why: runs/kickoff-hints.json source=allocator, brief non-empty, idea text begins "improve
existing target " -> improvement run. Guard 1b (non-empty dir) does not apply; the existing
repo IS the point. Repo REUSED: no dir creation, no git init, no gh repo create.

STRESS-TEST (non-interactive, ran as specified): the attack that landed was lens 3, the
toy-version trap. Housekeeping's toy version is CHURN - reworded prose plus duplicate tests
that look like work and change nothing. 102 tests on ~950 lines is already dense, so "more
tests" is a vanity metric here. Defence held on the other three lenses: there are 6 open
known-issues, of which 4 are actionable without any new feature. RESHAPE APPLIED: a
named-surface rule is written into the spec as a must-have - every added test must close a
NAMED untested surface, and test COUNT is explicitly barred from being an outcome.
verdict proceed (reshaped), confidence 7.

PRIOR-ART SCOUT (6 searches, closes KI-1 - the sweep the original kickoff could not run):
  S1 npm search "moon phase"      -> moon-phase-widget, celestial-moon, @lab-code/moonphase, bite-times
  S2 npm search "moon cli"        -> no moon-phase CLI; surfaced astronomia 4.2.0 MIT (real Meeus port)
  S3 gh search repos free-text    -> zero results
  S4 gh search --topic=moon-phase -> astral(py), TinyMoon(swift), moonmoji(emoji), lunar-phase-card
  S5 WebSearch                    -> lunarphase-js flagged as having "hemisphere options"
  S6 npm view + npm pack + GREP-VERIFY of lunarphase-js 2.0.3 (README is marketing, not evidence)
GREP EVIDENCE (the differentiator claim survived):
  core is  frac((JD - 2451550.1) / 29.53058770576)   <- naive mean-synodic modulo
  grep -riE "meeus|periodic|correction|evection" package/  -> NO HITS
  "hemisphere support" = swapping emoji glyphs (NORTHERN/SOUTHERN emoji maps), not mirrored art
  npm view lunarphase-js bin -> empty; it is a LIBRARY, not a CLI
  stance: build/keep - the accuracy claim and hemisphere-mirrored ASCII remain differentiated.
  astronomia 4.2.0 (MIT) is a genuine Meeus port but is a DEPENDENCY -> deliberately not
  adopted; zero-dep is an original must-have (recorded as a cycle-0 decision).

TASTE JUDGE (fresh fable subagent, spec text only): use-twice 7, product-not-demo 8,
scope-fits-night 8, one-memorable-thing 6. Verdict: "worth the night as scoped - a rare
housekeeping spec that names its own churn risk and bans it; load-bearing axis is
scope-fits-night, provided KI-1's sweep is treated as fallible and the KI-7 domain test is
SAMPLED rather than exhaustive." Both caveats folded into SPEC.md before lock (KI-7
must-have now says SAMPLED, not exhaustive; the KI-1 finding is written down as grep
evidence rather than as a conclusion).

TASTE CRITIQUE (conductor, at lock):
  (a) interesting after 10 uses - the PRODUCT yes, unchanged; this RUN's output is invisible
      to an end user by construction. Honest framing: the audience is the next maintainer.
  (b) the defaulted constraint that most caps this run is "no new features" combined with
      gear-1 crawl: it takes the one genuinely product-improving fix (KI-5 glyph redesign)
      off the table. Named explicitly rather than silently defaulted - KI-5 is deferred
      because of BUDGET, not because the defect is acceptable.
  (c) mitigation shipped instead: KI-5 gets pinned by a measuring test so it cannot drift.

VERIFICATION EVIDENCE (conductor-run, at kickoff):
  baseline test_cmd: node --test test/*.test.js
    -> tests 102 | pass 102 | fail 0 | duration_ms 1280.467171   PASS
  KI-3 resolution check (authored now):
    git -C /opt/targets/moon remote -v -> origin https://github.com/trmnmc/moon.git (fetch+push)
    gh auth status -> Logged in to github.com account trmnmc; scopes gist,read:org,repo,workflow
    -> KI-3 ("no git remote, gh auth unverified") RESOLVED, moved to state.resolved_issues
  git status --porcelain -> clean (no crashed-cycle salvage needed)

BUDGET / GEAR (evidence, not a guess): bin/swarm-budget.sh is NOT allowlisted for this
headless session -> permission denied, probe_failures=1. Gear taken from runs/allocator.json
(source=probe): posture=trickle, allow_premium_pct=0, opus_used_pct=95, weekly_used_pct=65 at
week_elapsed_pct=63. -> gear 1 crawl, k_cap 1, demote=true, promote blocked. This is the
CONSERVATIVE direction and matches the brief's "haiku-priced work types"; the evidence rule's
"never crawl without evidence" is satisfied by allocator.json, not by a clock fallback.

PLAYBOOK (apply_mode auto): swarm-playbook.sh parse permission-denied -> parsed by direct
Read (the documented fallback the original run also used). Applied L-003, L-008, L-016,
L-023-moon (REFUTE brief), L-024-moon (discriminator), L-026-repo-atlas (core-logic->fable).
Vetoed 7 lessons (L-006/007/011/018/020/021/022) as conductor-scoped, not user-vetoed: every
one targets a browser/SPA/React/env-key surface a zero-dep stdout CLI does not have.
Ledger line appended to playbook/applied.log by hand (script denied).

SWARM TOOLING FINDINGS for the morning report (hard rule 5 - reported, never fixed mid-run):
  1. KI-2 RECURRED: .claude/settings.json write denied again. additionalDirectories is still
     [] and swarm-budget.sh / swarm-playbook.sh / claude are not allowlisted.
  2. Step-11 headless zero-prompt assert COULD NOT BE RUN (claude not allowlisted).
     Reported as NOT-RUN, never as passed. Substitute empirical evidence, named as what it
     is: THIS session is itself a headless `claude -p` spawned by swarm-pacer.sh and has
     run to kickoff completion, and the pacer spawned a working headless cycle on
     2026-08-14 at 11:54. Headless cycles demonstrably run; the assert itself is unverified.
  3. playbook/learnings.md has DUPLICATE IDS: L-023, L-025, L-026 each appear twice with
     different content and different [source:] runs (repo-atlas 2026-08-13 vs moon
     2026-08-14). next_id:29 is consistent with max L-028, so the collision came from the
     moon WRAP_UP append, not from the counter. Disambiguated with -source suffixes here.

L-027 GUARD APPLIED (the incident this repo caused last run): heartbeat.next_wakeup_at was
pushed to now+2700 BEFORE any expensive kickoff work, so swarm-pacer.timer cannot spawn a
second conductor into this live session the way it did at 11:54:33 on 2026-08-14.

state: phase PLAN, cycle 0. DESIGN gate already satisfied (decisions[] non-empty from the
original build). Backlog reset to empty (canonical schema); the v0.1.0 build backlog used a
non-canonical schema and was archived to .swarm/backlog-v0.1.0.json.
outcome: kickoff complete, spec locked, baseline re-verified 102/102 green, KI-1 sweep
closed with grep evidence, KI-3 resolved.
next: cycle 1 = inline PLAN, building the named-surface backlog.

## cycle 1 | %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S+00:00 | moon | PLAN -> BUILD

work: inline PLAN (one sonnet Plan subagent proposes; the CONDUCTOR writes backlog.json).
why: backlog was empty after the improvement-run reset, and the PLAN gate holds until every
SPEC must-have is covered by an item. Gear 1 crawl (k_cap 1) makes PLAN the only sensible
opener anyway - a 45-min build wave does not admit at 1 item per wave without a backlog.

models: Plan subagent = sonnet (PLAN is not a listed judgment seat, so it is demotable;
gear-1 demote does not drop it below sonnet).

BACKLOG WRITTEN - 8 items, all todo:
  T-101 p1 docs  S haiku   propagate KI-1 prior-art finding -> README + REPORT
  T-102 p2 fix   S sonnet  KI-6: nextFullMoon throws instead of returning Invalid Date
  T-103 p3 fix   M sonnet  KI-7: declare supported domain + SAMPLED consistency test
  T-104 p4 test  S sonnet  KI-5: pin the documented glyph widths with a measuring test
  T-105 p5 test  S sonnet  package-manifest integrity (bin/main/zero-deps/files)
  T-106 p6 test  S sonnet  next-full-moon year-boundary branch
  T-107 p7 test  S sonnet  successful invocations write nothing to stderr
  T-108 p8 docs  S haiku   reconcile REPORT known-issues + hand-off (deps 101-104)

TRUST-NOTHING CHECK ON THE PLAN AGENT (hard rule 2 - its greps are CLAIMS). Every
"this surface is untested" claim was re-grepped by the conductor independently. All five
held; not one item was churn:
  T-105  grep -rn "package.json|require.resolve|dependencies" test/  -> ZERO hits
  T-107  grep -rn "stderr" test/  -> only cli.test.js:107-112, the --bogus exit-2 test
  T-106  grep -rn "getFullYear" src/ bin/ test/  -> exactly one hit, bin/moon.js:61 (the
         ternary that appends/omits the year); no test touches it in either direction
  T-104  grep -rniE "east asian|Ambiguous|2591|2592|258C" test/  -> ZERO hits
  T-103  grep -rniE "domain|supported range" src/astro.js README.md -> only a comment

  T-102  grep -rniE "RangeError|8640000000000000|275760" test/ -> ZERO; the two existing
         nextFullMoon throw-tests cover bad INPUT only, never out-of-range OUTPUT

CONDUCTOR-REPRODUCED DEFECTS (I did not take the known-issues text on trust):
  KI-6, reproduced exactly as documented:
    nextFullMoon(new Date(8.64e15)) -> Invalid Date        (silent)
    .toISOString()                  -> RangeError: Invalid time value
    nextFullMoon('not a date')      -> TypeError: nextFullMoon expects a valid Date
    -> the inconsistency is real: every other bad input throws, this one returns.
  KI-7, reproduced AND SHARPENED. The known-issue says the two series "contradict"; the
  usable form is a DISCRIMINATOR (L-024) - the phase name's illumination band must contain
  the reported illumination:
    new Date(4.0e15)  -> "waning gibbous"  ill=0.0385   gibbous but 3.85% lit
    new Date(-8.0e15) -> "waning crescent" ill=0.8053   crescent but 80.5% lit
  Domain bisect (conductor-measured, feeds T-103's declared range):
    violations in year -2000..6000, 32,004 sampled states : 0
    first band violation                                  : ~72,500 years from 1970
    -> recommending year 1000-3000 as the declared domain: inside the measured-clean
       region with wide margin, and it covers every realistic use.
  CLI exit codes, probed with spawnSync and the status read DIRECTLY (L-010, never
  through a pipe):
    no-args 0 | --json 0 | --help 0 | --south 0 | --block 0 | --bogus 2 (80b stderr)
    unknown-flag stderr: "moon: unknown option '--bogus' - run 'moon --help' ..."
    -> exit-code hygiene is already correct; NOT worth an item. One oddity noted but not
       filed: `--south --north` together exits 0 with no complaint (undocumented
       precedence). Left unfiled deliberately - pinning it would be inventing a contract
       the spec never made, and this run bans churn.

MUST-HAVE 6 ("playbook lessons applied") is covered by PROCESS, not by a backlog item, and
is recorded that way rather than padded with a filler item - inventing an item to tick a
checkbox is precisely the churn this SPEC bans. L-003/L-008/L-016/L-023/L-024 reach agents
through runfile.playbook.directives.prompt_lines; L-010 and L-024 are conductor verify
practice and were both exercised this cycle (exit statuses via spawnSync; the KI-7 band
discriminator instead of a remembered reference value).

ROUTING DEVIATION, recorded so the retro can check it: playbook L-026 recommends routing
the correctness core to fable even when small. T-102 and T-103 both touch src/astro.js but
NEITHER changes the Meeus math - T-102 adds a guard clause on a return value, T-103 adds a
declared constant plus a sampled test whose domain the conductor already measured. Neither
was flagged route_class:"core"; both route sonnet. Under trickle posture (allow_premium_pct
0, opus_used_pct 95) fable here would buy nothing.

WAKEUP MECHANISM: ScheduleWakeup NOT called - this is a VPS headless cycle and
swarm-pacer.timer (verified active) is the firing mechanism; it reads
heartbeat.next_wakeup_at, which is written above as now+90. cycle.md step 9: the conductor
writes next_wakeup_at identically either way, only the reader differs.

outcome: PLAN complete, 8-item backlog covering every must-have, 0 churn items, suite still
102/102 green. Next cycle: BUILD, k=1 (gear-1 crawl), starting T-101.
